Using pi2 from .NET programs
============================

Pi2 can be used from .NET languages like C# and Visual Basic .NET.
In short, you will need to add a reference to pi2cs library and create an instance of the Pi2 class.
The methods of the class can then be used to access Pi2 functionality.

In practice, all this is done using code like this::

	Pi2 pi = new Pi2();
	Pi2Image img = pi.NewImage(ImageDataType.UInt8, 100, 100, 100);
	pi.Noise(img, 100, 25);
	pi.WriteTif(img, "./noise");

The methods of the Pi2 class are documented in the standard XML documentation and they mostly correspond to
what is found in :ref:`command_reference`.


Depending on the agenda of the authors, the functionality in the Pi2 class might lag behind what is available in the Python interface.
However, all functionality is available through a low-level wrapper class PiLib.
In particular, it exposes method :code:`RunAndCheck` that can be used to run arbitrary Pi2 commands (see :ref:`command_reference`),
and :code:`GetImage` that returns pointer to image data stored in the Pi2 system.


Viewing Pi2 images
------------------

The pi2cs library contains controls Pi2PictureViewer, Pi2PictureToolStrip and Pi2PictureBox that can be used to show Pi2 images
on Windows Forms.
Of these three, Pi2PictureBox is a simple picture box mostly corresponding to the standard Windows Forms PictureBox, but it shows
image from the Pi2 system.
Pi2PictureViewer and Pi2PictureToolStrip provide more advanced user interface with functionality such as zooming and annotations.
At the time of writing, work with these controls is still very much in progress.
