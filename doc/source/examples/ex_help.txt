Help
====

This example shows how to use the :ref:`help` command and commands related to it::

	def help():
		"""
		Demonstrates Pi2 help commands.
		IPython docstrings contain the same information.
		"""

		# Show generic info
		pi.info()

		# Show license(s) related to the pi2
		pi.license()

		# List all available commands
		pi.help()

		# Show help for convert command
		pi.help('convert')
	
	
Output of this example very lengthy and is not shown here. Part of the output can be seen on the :ref:`formatted_license`, :ref:`command_reference`, and :ref:`convert` pages.

In addition to the :ref:`help` command, the iPython help system (TAB and ?) and .NET XML API documentation are supported.
