Read and write images
=====================


This example shows how to read and write images in various file formats::

	def read_and_write_image():
		"""
		Demonstrates reading and writing images.
		"""

		# .tif image
		img1 = pi.read(input_file('t1-head.tif'))

		# .png image
		img2 = pi.read(input_file('uint8.png'))

		# .raw file
		img3 = pi.read(input_file('t1-head_bin_'))

		# Save sequence. The @(3) declares that the file name should contain 3 numeric digits in the place of @, e.g. head_001_bin.tif.
		pi.writesequence(img3, output_file('binary_head/head_@(3)_bin.tif'))

		# Read sequence back. Notice that reading does not support (3) directive in the sequence template!
		img4 = pi.read(output_file('binary_head/head_@_bin.tif'))

		# Images can also be read into existing images.
		pi.read(output_file('binary_head/head_@_bin.tif'), target_image=img1)

		# When saving .raw files, the dimensions are appended to the file name
		pi.writeraw(img2, output_file('uint8_as_raw'))

		# When reading .raw files, it is not necessary to give the dimensions and .raw suffix
		# if the given part of the file name identifies an unique .raw file
		img2 = pi.read(output_file('uint8_as_raw'))
