Spherical coordinates
=====================

Orientation-related commands (e.g. :ref:`cylinderorientation`) use spherical coordinates defined in the figure below.
Namely, :math:`\phi` refers to the azimuthal angle and :math:`\theta` to the polar angle.
The azimuthal angle is measured in :math:`xy`-plane from the positive :math:`x`-axis towards the positive :math:`y`-axis,
and its values are always in the range :math:`[-\pi, \pi]`.
The polar angle is measured from the positive :math:`z`-axis towards the :math:`xy`-plane, and its values
are always in the range :math:`[0, \pi]`.

   Spherical coordinate system used in pi2. Here, :math:`\phi` is the azimuthal angle and :math:`\theta` is the polar angle.


Conversion from the cartesian coordinates to the polar coordinates is done with

.. math::

	r &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \\
	\phi &= \operatorname{arctan2}(y, x) \\
	\theta &= \arccos(z / r)
	
Conversion from the polar coordinates to the cartesian coordinates is done with

.. math::
	
	x &= r \cos(\phi) sin(\theta) \\
	y &= r \sin(\phi) sin(\theta) \\
	z &= r \cos(\theta)
	
Most orientation-related commands return only angles for which the cartesian :math:`x`-component is positive.
This is because the orientations are symmetrical, i.e. directions :math:`-\vec{r}` and :math:`\vec{r}` describe the same orientation,
and therefore half of the possible directions are redundant.
Additionally, in orientation-related commands :math:`r=1` most of the time.
