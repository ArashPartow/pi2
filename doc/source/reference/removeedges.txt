.. _removeedges:

removeedges
***********


**Syntax:** :code:`removeedges(vertices, edges, edge measurements, edge points, flags, disconnect straight-through nodes, remove isolated nodes)`

Prunes the network by removing user-selected edges from it. The edges to be removed are specified in an image, having one pixel for each edge, where non-zero value specifies that the corresponding edge is to be removed.

This command cannot be used in a distributed processing mode. If you need it, please contact the authors.

Arguments
---------

vertices [input & output]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Data type:** float32 image

Image where vertex coordinates are stored. See :ref:`tracelineskeleton` command.

edges [input & output]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Data type:** uint64 image

Image where vertex indices corresponding to each edge are stored. See :ref:`tracelineskeleton` command.

edge measurements [input & output]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Data type:** float32 image

Image where properties of each edge are stored.  ee :ref:`tracelineskeleton` command.

edge points [input & output]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Data type:** int32 image

Image that stores some points on each edge. See :ref:`tracelineskeleton` command.

flags [input]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Data type:** uint8 image, uint16 image, uint32 image, uint64 image, int8 image, int16 image, int32 image, int64 image, float32 image

Image that has as many pixels as there are edges. Edges corresponding to non-zero pixels are removed.

disconnect straight-through nodes [input]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Data type:** boolean

If set to true, all straight-through nodes (nodes with degree = 2) are removed after pruning. This operation might change the network even if no edges are pruned.

remove isolated nodes [input]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Data type:** boolean

If set to true, all isolated nodes (nodes with degree = 0) are removed after pruning. This operation might change the network even if no edges are pruned.
