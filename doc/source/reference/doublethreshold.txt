.. _doublethreshold:

doublethreshold
***************


**Syntax:** :code:`doublethreshold(image, first threshold, second threshold)`

Sets pixel to 0 if its value is less than the first threshold. Sets pixel to 1 if pixel its is larger than or equal to the first threshold and less than the second threshold (if any). Sets pixel to 2 if pixel its is larger than or equal to the second threshold.

This command can be used in a distributed processing mode. Use 'distribute' command to change processing mode from local to distributed.
