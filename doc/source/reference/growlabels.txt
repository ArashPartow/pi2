.. _growlabels:

growlabels
**********


**Syntax:** :code:`growlabels(image, allowed color, background color, connectivity)`

Grows all colored regions as much as possible into pixels that have a specific color. In practice, this command first finds all unique colors in the image, and uses each set of pixels having the same color as seed points for a flood fill that proceeds to pixels whose value is given in the 'allowed color' argument. 

This growing method is suited only for situations where separate parts of the original structure are labelled and the labels must be grown back to the original structure. **If there are multiple labels in a connected component, non-labeled pixels are assigned the smallest label in the non-distributed version and (mostly) random label among all the possibilities in the distributed version.** Therefore, **this function is suited only for images containing separate blobs or particles**, where each particle contains seed point(s) of only single value. 

An alternative to this command is :ref:`morphorec`. It works such that each pixel will get the label of the nearest labeled pixel.

This command can be used in a distributed processing mode. Use 'distribute' command to change processing mode from local to distributed.

Arguments
---------

image [input & output]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Data type:** uint8 image, uint16 image, uint32 image, uint64 image, int8 image, int16 image, int32 image, int64 image, float32 image

Image to process.

allowed color [input]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Data type:** real

Color where other colors will be grown into.

background color [input]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Data type:** real

Background color. Values of pixels having this color are not changed. Set to the same value than allowed color to fill to all pixels.

connectivity [input]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Data type:** connectivity

**Default value:** Nearest

Connectivity of the regions to grow. Can be Nearest for connectivity to nearest neighbours only, or All for connectivity to all neighbours.
