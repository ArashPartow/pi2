This file contains notes about compiling and running pi2 in various cluster environments.



PSI Ra cluster
--------------

The required module load commands are:
module load gcc/7.3.0
module load Python/3.6.3

Please compile without Python module as there seems to be some incompatibility between some gcc and Python modules.

The required module load commands are:
module load gcc/7.3.0
module load fftw
